# Predicting-AF-among-ESUS-Patients

This repository serves to track the progress of our ESUS-AF project. It includes a high-level research plan and up-to-date progress report.

## Aim One

Externally validate existing SOTA risk scores in our ESUS patient cohort, including HAVOC, Brown ESUS-AF, CHA2DS2-VASc, and C2HEST.

## Aim Two

Build a new tree-based machine learning model to predict AF among ESUS patients, including random forest and gradient boosting classifiers.

## Aim Three

Develop understandings about different embedding vector generation methods, including unsupervised (deepwalk, autoencoder), transfer learning without fine tuning, transfer learning with fine tuning (mlp-tuning, hg-tuning).

## Aim Four

Develop understandings about tbe role of individual data compoenents in predicting AF, including ICD, labs, ECG, and ECHO.
